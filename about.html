                        After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                        I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews 
                        of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                <p class="post-desc">
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours 
                    and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using 
                    what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.<br />
                    <br />
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share 
                    what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p>

                <h2 class="post-sub">How I got started I started</h2>
                <p class="post-desc">
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would 
                    take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
                    I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but 
                    also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.<br />
                    <br />
                    That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting
                    my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
